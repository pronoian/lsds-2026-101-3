# Coding guidelines

- Use git commits and pushes (copying and pasting code through the GitHub web UI is not allowed). [Help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_23KUAEtUM)
- Use informative commit messages. [Help](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#commit-message-with-description-and-breaking-change-footer)
- Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- Format your code with [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html)
- Don't add unnecessary comments to your code, we know how to read code!

> [!TIP]
> In code projects, adhering to coding standards and using formatters like black allows all contributors to produce more cohesive code.

# Plagiarism

Submitting a project which contains code you have not authored or don't understand is considered plagiarism.

- You MUST NOT ask other students for their project or fragments of their code.
- You MUST add a link next to any code you copy from external sources.
- You MUST NOT share your code with other students even if they ask you to.
- You MUST commit frequently to the repository (at least 1 commit per exercise).
- You MAY discuss the assignments with other students, but you may not look at or copy each others' code.
- You MUST make your repository private.
- You MUST NOT look at anyone else's solutions, including previous year students.

In case copying is suspected, the School Direction will be informed as per [the protocol](https://www.upf.edu/web/usquid-etic/plag-doc-teachers). These offenses are [sanctioned](https://seuelectronica.upf.edu/regim-disciplinari-dels-estudiants-de-la-universitat-pompeu-fabra) with temporary expulsion from the University, loss of the right to be assessed in all or part of the courses, and/or others.
